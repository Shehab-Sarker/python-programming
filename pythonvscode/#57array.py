#Different between list and array in python
#Python Lists: Collects items of multiple data types
"""users more memory,Flexible easy to modify, No need a for specific loop to
access the componenets,good for shorter sequence of data"""
#Python arrays: Collects items of same data type
"""uses less memory,not flexible,Difficult to modify, needs a loop to access the 
components of array,Good for longer sequence of data"""
